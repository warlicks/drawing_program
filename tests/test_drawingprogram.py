from DrawingProgram import DrawingProgramIterator

# from assignment directions:
# assuming drawing_program = DrawingProgram(), the following code should work
# for shape in drawing_program:
# print(shape)


# TO TEST for DrawingProgram:
# note to self: can pass in any of: Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle

# __init__(self, Shapes = None or list or non-list should throw exception

# add_shape(self, Shape): should append to list self.shapes

# remove_shape(self, Shape): should remove, list the number of tmes it was removed, return count
# return exception if shape isn't in list


# print_shapes(self, Shape):

# sort_shapes(self): check shapes will be sorted by name, then area if names are same

# __str__(self): check by running print on DrawingProgram object

# get_shape(self, index): returns the shape at the specified index

# set_shape(self, index, Shape): replaces the shape at the specified index
